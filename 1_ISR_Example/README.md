# Project: ISR Example using the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
In this project, two LEDs are connected to GPIO ports PB0 and PB1 of the Atmega324p microcontroller. We set up only a single interrupt pin. We choose Atmega324p pin (PD7 / PCINT31). As a result of pressing the button, the two LEDs should light up for 250 ms.

## Simulation of the ISR Example using Proteus Simulation Software
